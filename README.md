This is an ongoing project using both Python and Frontend. This project gives comprehensive analysis on Formula one 2022 season and how the drivers have performed over the season. On top of that, there is an in-depth anaylis
by the team and the outstanding work they have done over the season. This is currently under development and still requires hours of works to be done before a decent look. I will keep updating on the progress and hope
you will enjoy it once it is complete. Thank you
